Validate if a given string can be interpreted as a decimal number.

Some examples:
"0" => true
" 0.1 " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true
" -90e3   " => true
" 1e" => false
"e3" => false
" 6e-1" => true
" 99e2.5 " => false
"53.5e93" => true
" --6 " => false
"-+3" => false
"95a54e53" => false

Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one. However, here is a list of characters that can be in a valid decimal number:


	Numbers 0-9
	Exponent - "e"
	Positive/negative sign - "+"/"-"
	Decimal point - "."


Of course, the context of these characters also matters in the input.

Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:


	A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
	Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
	The input array words contains at least one word.

We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:


	If the length of the string is 1, stop.
	If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
		Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
		Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
		Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
	
	


Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.

Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.

 

Method read4: 

The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.

Definition of read4:

    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int

Note: buf4[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf4[]


Below is a high level example of how read4 works:



File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf = "e", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf = "", fp points to end of file


 

Method read:

By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Definition of read: 

    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]

Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.

Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:


	val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. 
	isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.


class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:


	If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
	If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
	Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

Quad-Tree format:

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].

If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from "A", "C", "G", "T".

Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.

For example, "AACCGGTT" -> "AACCGGTA" is 1 mutation.

Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.

Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such a mutation, return -1.

Note:


	Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
	If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
	You may assume start and end string is not the same.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

Note that the number of times an item is used is the number of calls to the get and put functions for that item since it was inserted. This number is set to zero when the item is removed.

There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up (u), down (d), left (l) or right (r), but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.

Given the ball position, the hole position and the maze, find out how the ball could drop into the hole by moving the shortest distance. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the hole (included). Output the moving directions by using 'u', 'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different shortest ways, you should output the lexicographically smallest way. If the ball cannot reach the hole, output "impossible".

SQL SchemaTable: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.


 

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |

| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |

| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

SQL SchemaTable: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.


 

Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.

Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix. 

Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:


	val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. 
	isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.


class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:


	If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
	If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
	Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

Quad-Tree format:

The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].

If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

	Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude, longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).


Input Format:
The insurance table is described as follows:

| Column Name | Type          |

| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |


where PID is the policyholder's policy ID, TIV_2015 is the total investment value in 2015, TIV_2016 is the total investment value in 2016, LAT is the latitude of the policy holder's city, and LON is the longitude of the policy holder's city.

Sample Input

| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |

Sample Output

| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |


Explanation

The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.

Explanation

The customer with number '3' has two orders, which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number '3'.


Follow up: What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

SQL SchemaGiven a table tree, id is identifier of the tree node and p_id is its parent node's id.

+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:


	Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
	Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
	Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.


 
Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:

 

+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+


 

Explanation

 


	Node '1' is root node, because its parent node is NULL and it has child node '2' and '3'.
	Node '2' is inner node, because it has parent node '1' and child node '4' and '5'.
	Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf node, because they have parent node and they don't have child node.
	
	And here is the image of the sample tree as below:
	 

				  1
			/   \
                      2       3
                    /   \
                  4       5


	Note

	If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.

SQL SchemaTable point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

 

| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |

Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.

The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";" will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.


After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

Normally, the factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

We instead make a clumsy factorial: using the integers in decreasing order, we swap out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations: multiply (*), divide (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this order.

For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.  However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 equals 11.  This guarantees the result is an integer.

Implement the clumsy function as defined above: given an integer N, it returns the clumsy factorial of N.

Three stones are on a number line at positions a, b, and c.

Each turn, you pick up a stone at an endpoint (ie., either the lowest or highest position stone), and move it to an unoccupied position between those endpoints.  Formally, let's say the stones are currently at positions x, y, z with x .  You pick up the stone at either position x or position z, and move that stone to an integer position k, with x  and k != y.

On an infinite number line, the position of the i-th stone is given by stones[i].  Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position.

Each turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N . Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

(If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together.

Each number is given in array format:  as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit.  For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] represents the number (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3.  A number arr in array, format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either arr == [0] or arr[0] == 1.

Return the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros.

Under a grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words.  Let's use R(expr) to denote the set of words the expression represents.

Grammar can best be understood through simple examples:


	Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
	
		R("a") = {"a"}
		R("w") = {"w"}
	
	
	When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
	
		R("{a,b,c}") = {"a","b","c"}
		R("{{a,b},{b,c}}") = {"a","b","c"} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)
	
	
	When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
	
		R("{a,b}{c,d}") = {"ac","ad","bc","bd"}
		R("a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}") = {"abdfg", "abdfh", "abefg", "abefh", "acdfg", "acdfh", "acefg", "acefh"}
	
	


Formally, the 3 rules for our grammar:


	For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}
	For expressions e_1, e_2, ... , e_k with k >= 2, we have R({e_1,e_2,...}) = R(e_1) ∪ R(e_2) ∪ ...
	For expressions e_1 and e_2, we have R(e_1 + e_2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e_1) × R(e_2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.


Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.


 

We define the install date of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define day 1 retention of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.

The query result format is in the following example:

In a social group, there are N people, with unique integer ids from 0 to N-1.

We have a list of logs, where each logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B] contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.

Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.

We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1].

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width shelf_width.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is ), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:


	It is the empty string, or
	It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
	It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.


We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:


	depth("") = 0
	depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
	depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.


For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

 

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.

Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

There are two kinds of threads, oxygen and hydrogen. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:


	If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.
	If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.


We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:


	Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
	The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
	The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.


Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 , and the second player names a value y with 1  and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

Implement a thread safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:


	BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity) The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum capacity.
	void enqueue(int element) Adds an element to the front of the queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full.
	int dequeue() Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it. If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.
	int size() Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.


Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the enqueue method or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the dequeue method. The size method will be called after every test case.

Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n, however:


	If the number is divisible by 3, output "fizz".
	If the number is divisible by 5, output "buzz".
	If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "fizzbuzz".


For example, for n = 15, we output: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz.

Suppose you are given the following code:

class FizzBuzz {
  public FizzBuzz(int n) { ... }               // constructor
  public void fizz(printFizz) { ... }          // only output "fizz"
  public void buzz(printBuzz) { ... }          // only output "buzz"
  public void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz) { ... }  // only output "fizzbuzz"
  public void number(printNumber) { ... }      // only output the numbers
}

Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. The same instance of FizzBuzz will be passed to four different threads:


	Thread A will call fizz() to check for divisibility of 3 and outputs fizz.
	Thread B will call buzz() to check for divisibility of 5 and outputs buzz.
	Thread C will call fizzbuzz() to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and outputs fizzbuzz.
	Thread D will call number() which should only output the numbers.

| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id is the primary key column for this table.
This table has the information about all people waiting for an elevator.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.


 

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is 1000.

Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person who will fit in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit. It is guaranteed that the person who is first in the queue can fit in the elevator.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queue table
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name       | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| 5         | George Washington | 250    | 1    |
| 3         | John Adams        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | Thomas Jefferson  | 400    | 3    |
| 2         | Will Johnliams    | 200    | 4    |
| 4         | Thomas Jefferson  | 175    | 5    |
| 1         | James Elephant    | 500    | 6    |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+

Result table
+-------------------+
| person_name       |
+-------------------+
| Thomas Jefferson  |
+-------------------+

Queue table is ordered by turn in the example for simplicity.
In the example George Washington(id 5), John Adams(id 3) and Thomas Jefferson(id 6) will enter the elevator as their weight sum is 250 + 350 + 400 = 1000.
Thomas Jefferson(id 6) is the last person to fit in the elevator because he has the last turn in these three people.

Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.

For example: we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:


Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add , erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

To be specific, your design should include these functions:


	bool search(int target) : Return whether the target exists in the Skiplist or not.
	void add(int num): Insert a value into the SkipList. 
	bool erase(int num): Remove a value in the Skiplist. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.


See more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

In an n*n grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at (0, 0) and (0, 1). The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at (n-1, n-2) and (n-1, n-1).

In one move the snake can:


	Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.
	Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.
	Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from (r, c) and (r, c+1) to (r, c) and (r+1, c).
	
	Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from (r, c) and (r+1, c) to (r, c) and (r, c+1).

There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.


 

We define query quality as:


The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.


We also define poor query percentage as:


The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.


Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Primary key for this table is success_date.
Succeeded table contains the days of succeeded tasks.


 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Order result by start_date.

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.



The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org

 

The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:


	philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
	pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
	eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
	putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
	The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).


Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

Given a url startUrl and an interface HtmlParser, implement a web crawler to crawl all links that are under the same hostname as startUrl. 

Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.

Your crawler should:


	Start from the page: startUrl
	Call HtmlParser.getUrls(url) to get all urls from a webpage of given url.
	Do not crawl the same link twice.
	Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as startUrl.




As shown in the example url above, the hostname is example.org. For simplicity sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port specified. For example, the urls http://leetcode.com/problems and http://leetcode.com/contest are under the same hostname, while urls http://example.org/test and http://example.com/abc are not under the same hostname.

The HtmlParser interface is defined as such: 

interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.
  public List getUrls(String url);
}

Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing purposes you'll have three variables urls, edges and startUrl. Notice that you will only have access to startUrl in your code, while urls and edges are not directly accessible to you in code.

The function interface is defined like this: 

interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integer x and y.
  int f(int x, int y);
};


For custom testing purposes you're given an integer function_id and a target z as input, where function_id represent one function from an secret internal list, on the examples you'll know only two functions from the list.

There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments is sub_id for another post in the table.


 

Write an SQL query to find number of comments per each post.

Result table should contain post_id and its corresponding number_of_comments, and must be sorted by post_id in ascending order.

Submissions may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of unique comments per post.

Submissions may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The query result format is in the following example:

Submissions table:

| 10      | 2          |

| 12      | 0                  |
+---------+--------------------+

The post with id 1 has three comments in the table with id 3, 4 and 9. The comment with id 3 is repeated in the table, we counted it only once.
The post with id 2 has two comments in the table with id 5 and 10.
The post with id 12 has no comments in the table.
The comment with id 6 is a comment on a deleted post with id 7 so we ignored it.

Given a url startUrl and an interface HtmlParser, implement a Multi-threaded web crawler to crawl all links that are under the same hostname as startUrl. 

Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.

	Start from the page: startUrl
	Call HtmlParser.getUrls(url) to get all urls from a webpage of given url.
	Do not crawl the same link twice.
	Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as startUrl.




As shown in the example url above, the hostname is example.org. For simplicity sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port specified. For example, the urls http://leetcode.com/problems and http://leetcode.com/contest are under the same hostname, while urls http://example.org/test and http://example.com/abc are not under the same hostname.

The HtmlParser interface is defined as such: 

interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.
  // This is a blocking call, that means it will do HTTP request and return when this request is finished.
  public List getUrls(String url);
}

Note that getUrls(String url) simulates performing a HTTP request. You can treat it as a blocking function call which waits for a HTTP request to finish. It is guaranteed that getUrls(String url) will return the urls within 15ms.  Single-threaded solutions will exceed the time limit so, can your multi-threaded web crawler do better?

Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing purposes you'll have three variables urls, edges and startUrl. Notice that you will only have access to startUrl in your code, while urls and edges are not directly accessible to you in code.

 

Follow up:


	Assume we have 10,000 nodes and 1 billion URLs to crawl. We will deploy the same software onto each node. The software can know about all the nodes. We have to minimize communication between machines and make sure each node does equal amount of work. How would your web crawler design change?
	What if one node fails or does not work?
	How do you know when the crawler is done?

Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by a grid of size m x n, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.

Your task is move the box 'B' to the target position 'T' under the following rules:


	Player is represented by character 'S' and can move up, down, left, right in the grid if it is a floor (empy cell).
	Floor is represented by character '.' that means free cell to walk.
	Wall is represented by character '#' that means obstacle  (impossible to walk there). 
	There is only one box 'B' and one target cell 'T' in the grid.
	The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a push.
	The player cannot walk through the box.


Return the minimum number of pushes to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return -1.

	The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.
	"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
	The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
	The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
	No more moves can be played if the game is over.


Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

There is an intersection of two roads. First road is road A where cars travel from North to South in direction 1 and from South to North in direction 2. Second road is road B where cars travel from West to East in direction 3 and from East to West in direction 4.



There is a traffic light located on each road before the intersection. A traffic light can either be green or red.


	Green means cars can cross the intersection in both directions of the road.
	Red means cars in both directions cannot cross the intersection and must wait until the light turns green.


The traffic lights cannot be green on both roads at the same time. That means when the light is green on road A, it is red on road B and when the light is green on road B, it is red on road A.

Initially, the traffic light is green on road A and red on road B. When the light is green on one road, all cars can cross the intersection in both directions until the light becomes green on the other road. No two cars traveling on different roads should cross at the same time.

Design a deadlock-free traffic light controlled system at this intersection.

Implement the function void carArrived(carId, roadId, direction, turnGreen, crossCar) where:


	carId is the id of the car that arrived.
	roadId is the id of the road that the car travels on.
	direction is the direction of the car.
	turnGreen is a function you can call to turn the traffic light to green on the current road.
	crossCar is a function you can call to let the current car cross the intersection.


Your answer is considered correct if it avoids cars deadlock in the intersection. Turning the light green on a road when it was already green is considered a wrong answer.

There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has done a transaction of amount in transaction_date.
It is guaranteed that the user has visited the bank in the transaction_date.(i.e The Visits table contains (user_id, transaction_date) in one row)


 

A bank wants to draw a chart of the number of transactions bank visitors did in one visit to the bank and the corresponding number of visitors who have done this number of transaction in one visit.

Write an SQL query to find how many users visited the bank and didn't do any transactions, how many visited the bank and did one transaction and so on.

The result table will contain two columns:


	transactions_count which is the number of transactions done in one visit.
	visits_count which is the corresponding number of users who did transactions_count in one visit to the bank.


transactions_count should take all values from 0 to max(transactions_count) done by one or more users.

Order the result table by transactions_count.

The query result format is in the following example:

Visits table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |

| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes = 49%
For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes = 24%
The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 * (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.

We will use a file-sharing system to share a very large file which consists of m small chunks with IDs from 1 to m.

When users join the system, the system should assign a unique ID to them. The unique ID should be used once for each user, but when a user leaves the system, the ID can be reused again.

Users can request a certain chunk of the file, the system should return a list of IDs of all the users who own this chunk. If the user receive a non-empty list of IDs, they receive the requested chunk successfully.


Implement the FileSharing class:


	FileSharing(int m) Initializes the object with a file of m chunks.
	int join(int[] ownedChunks): A new user joined the system owning some chunks of the file, the system should assign an id to the user which is the smallest positive integer not taken by any other user. Return the assigned id.
	void leave(int userID): The user with userID will leave the system, you cannot take file chunks from them anymore.
	int[] request(int userID, int chunkID): The user userID requested the file chunk with chunkID. Return a list of the IDs of all users that own this chunk sorted in ascending order.


 

Follow-ups:


	What happens if the system identifies the user by their IP address instead of their unique ID and users disconnect and connect from the system with the same IP?
	If the users in the system join and leave the system frequently without requesting any chunks, will your solution still be efficient?
	If all each user join the system one time, request all files and then leave, will your solution still be efficient?
	If the system will be used to share n files where the ith file consists of m[i], what are the changes you have to do?

Given all the nodes of an N-ary tree as an array  Node[] tree where each node has a unique value.

Find and return the root of the N-ary tree.

 

Follow up:

Could you solve this problem in constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm?

 

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).



For example, the above tree is serialized as [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].


Custom testing:
You should provide the serialization of the input tree.
The Driver code then extracts the nodes from the tree and shuffles them. You shouldn't care how the extracted nodes are shuffled.
The driver code will provide you with an array of the extracted nodes in random order and you need to find the root of the tree out of these nodes.

You should move the subtree of the node p to become a direct child of node q. If p is already a direct child of q, don't change anything. Node p must be the last child in the children list of node q.

Return the root of the tree after adjusting it.

 

There are 3 cases for nodes p and q:


	Node q is in the sub-tree of node p.
	Node p is in the sub-tree of node q.
	Neither node p is in the sub-tree of node q nor node q is in the sub-tree of node p.


In cases 2 and 3, you just need to move p (with its sub-tree) to be a child of q, but in case 1 the tree may be disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again. Please read the examples carefully before solving this problem.

For example, to compress the string "aabccc" we replace "aa" by "a2" and replace "ccc" by "c3". Thus the compressed string becomes "a2bc3".

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.

Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.

Given two strings s and t, your goal is to convert s into t in k moves or less.

During the ith (1 ) move you can:


	Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1  and j has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.
	Do nothing.


Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.

Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.

Return true if it's possible to convert s into t in no more than k moves, otherwise return false.

sale_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold.



Since table Sales was filled manually in the year 2000, product_name may contain leading and/or trailing white spaces, also they are case-insensitive.

Write an SQL query to report


	product_name in lowercase without leading or trailing white spaces.
	sale_date in the format ('YYYY-MM') 
	total the number of times the product was sold in this month.


Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending order, in case of a tie order it by sale_date in ascending order.

A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:


	0 
	s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.


To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

Notice that an empty string is also good.

Given two positive integers n and k, the binary string  Sn is formed as follows:


	S1 = "0"
	Si = Si-1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si-1)) for i > 1


Where + denotes the concatenation operation, reverse(x) returns the reversed string x, and invert(x) inverts all the bits in x (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0).

For example, the first 4 strings in the above sequence are:


	S1 = "0"
	S2 = "011"
	S3 = "0111001"
	S4 = "011100110110001"

Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.

Given a 2D array of characters grid of size m x n, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in grid.

A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the same value of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) is invalid because from (1, 2) we visited (1, 1) which was the last visited cell.

Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):


	BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
	boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
	int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.
	boolean hasPrev() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the left of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
	int prev() Moves the pointer to the left, then returns the number at the pointer.


Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that next() and prev() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next/previous number in the in-order traversal when next()/prev() is called.

Follow up: Could you solve the problem without precalculating the values of the tree?

SQL SchemaTable: Users

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| account      | int     |
| name         | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
account is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the account number of each user in the bank.


 

Table: Transactions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| trans_id      | int     |
| account       | int     |
| amount        | int     |
| transacted_on | date    |
+---------------+---------+
trans_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains all changes made to all accounts.
amount is positive if the user received money and negative if they transferred money.
All accounts start with a balance 0.


 

Write an SQL query to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than 10000. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of the amounts of all transactions involving that account.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Users table:
+------------+--------------+
| account    | name         |
+------------+--------------+
| 900001     | Alice        |
| 900002     | Bob          |
| 900003     | Charlie      |
+------------+--------------+

Transactions table:
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| trans_id   | account    | amount     | transacted_on |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 900001     | 7000       |  2020-08-01   |

Result table:
+------------+------------+
| name       | balance    |
+------------+------------+
| Alice      | 11000      |
+------------+------------+
Alice's balance is (7000 + 7000 - 3000) = 11000.
Bob's balance is 1000.
Charlie's balance is (6000 + 6000 - 4000) = 8000.

Given an array of positive integers arr, calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Return the sum of all odd-length subarrays of arr.

We have an array of integers, nums, and an array of requests where requests[i] = [starti, endi]. The ith request asks for the sum of nums[starti] + nums[starti + 1] + ... + nums[endi - 1] + nums[endi]. Both starti and endi are 0-indexed.

Return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of nums.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Given an array of positive integers nums, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by p. It is not allowed to remove the whole array.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.

There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:


	On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
	Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, the same color cannot be used again.


You are given a m x n matrix targetGrid, where targetGrid[row][col] is the color in the position (row, col) of the grid.

Return true if it is possible to print the matrix targetGrid, otherwise, return false.

You are given a string text of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that text contains at least one word.

Rearrange the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is maximized. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the extra spaces at the end, meaning the returned string should be the same length as text.

Return the string after rearranging the spaces.

Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.

You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

You are given a rows x cols matrix grid. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and ending in the bottom-right corner (rows - 1, cols - 1), find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the maximum non-negative product modulo 109 + 7. If the maximum product is negative return -1.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.

You are given two groups of points where the first group has size1 points, the second group has size2 points, and size1 >= size2.

The cost of the connection between any two points are given in an size1 x size2 matrix where cost[i][j] is the cost of connecting point i of the first group and point j of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.
